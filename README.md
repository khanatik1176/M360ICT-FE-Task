## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Deployment

The recommended deployment platform is **Netlify**. Refer to the [Netlify Deployment Guide](https://docs.netlify.com/) for more details.

### Deploying with Netlify CLI

1. Install Netlify CLI if you havenâ€™t already:
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Login to Netlify:
   
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

   Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Netlify account.

3. Navigate to your project directory and deploy:
   
   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```

   This will initialize the deployment process and prompt you with options.

4. For deploying updates to production, use:
   
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### Deploying to Development and Preview Environments

- **Development Environment:**
  
  ```bash
  netlify deploy --env development
  ```
  
  This helps in testing changes before pushing them to production.

- **Preview Deployment:**
  
  ```bash
  netlify deploy --branch preview
  ```
  
  This will deploy the branch as a preview, which can be shared and tested before going live.

### Assigning a Custom Domain

- **Add your domain to Netlify:**
  
  ```bash
  netlify domains:add yourdomain.com
  ```

- **Update your DNS settings** by following the instructions provided by Netlify.

- **Set the domain for production:**
  
  ```bash
  netlify domains:set yourdomain.com
  ```

- **Verify the domain:**
  
  ```bash
  netlify domains:inspect yourdomain.com
  ```

### Logging Out

To log out of the Netlify CLI:

```bash
netlify logout
```
